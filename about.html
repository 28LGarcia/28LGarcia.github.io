        <img src="img/meandmaddy.jpeg" alt="mygirl">
        <p>This is a photo of me and my girlfriend. Her name is Madison Hartman and she has a cat jinxey. He meows outside her room every morning for food even though hes already been fed.
            Her favorite color is pink and shes so good at baton which is the sport she does, she wants 2 kids an older brother and younger sister along with millions of cats and dogs. One of her favorite snacks is regular rice cakes with chocolate peanut butter and m&m's, she loves sushi and will eat it anytime, she loves subway its her favorite place to get subs. Shes gonna beg you for chocolate when its that time of the month because its her favorite candy and if you dont get her it she'll be upset. She enjoys chocolate covered raspberries too and shes lactose intolerant and will get a bad tummy ache if she has ice cream, her favorite kind is moose tracks. Never ever lie to her itll make you feel the most guilt ever and when she cries itll make you wanna cry. Shes so kind to everybody she meets and tries to be an amazing person to them even if they arent so nice to her. She is gonna want a big pink closet and a pink house. She wants to be a teacher and teach preschoolers because she loves kids, never show her baby videos or shes gonna get baby fever. She gets tummy aches all the time but cant help it so all you can do is comfort her. she gets very worried about her looks and thinks she doesnt look good even though shes the most beautiful and loving and kind woman in the world. I gotta stop yapping about her now though my hands hurt.
